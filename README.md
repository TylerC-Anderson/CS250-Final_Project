# CS250-Final_Project

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
 - Interpreting user needs involves reading betweeen the lines to see what the users actually want and need, which isn't always the same thing as what they are asking for. These needs and requests should be implemented in a way that is extendable and maintainable for the user, but also ideally provides value as soon as possible and iterates on that value to provide an increasingly better product. The way this is done is by creating user stories, which will assist developers in seeing the steps the user will take and how it might look to the people using the programs. This information from creating the user stories helps focus the development and also allows stakeholders to provide input at all steps during the project's development.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
 - I use the concept of small, iterative development with just about every project I work on now. It has helped me more effectively use OOP principles and make my code more legible and organized. When it's not just me working on the project, I look forward to using standups and collaborative principles within the Agile methodology as well.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
 - Being considerate and communicating often with your team is paramount. Also being flexible and helpful is very important, as software development benefits greatly from a flexible work style.
